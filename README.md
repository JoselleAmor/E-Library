***READ THE INSTRUCTIONS***


Task: Create a system for users to borrow books from a local library.

Books have the following attributes:

Title
Author
Genre
ISBN

ISBN numbers are unique to each book.

You need to be able to identify if a book is in the library's collection or has been borrowed by another user.

Books also need to know when they're being borrowed or returned to the collection.

Genres the library has are only Computer Science, Philosophy, Pure Science, Art and Recreation, and History

The library itself has to be able to:

know how many books it has
know what books it has
know how many are currently lent out
add more books
lend books
accept returned books
Finally, users should be able to borrow and return books! All the library needs to know from the user is of course their full name, address, and what books they're borrowing.

Generate the classes for the system, and make sure that you test these classes in your code. Make sure to include comments as to why you chose to implement a method/variable/etc as such. Make sure to follow OOP principles (encapsulate when necessary, apply inheritance when necessary, etc)

Submit your source code's github link.
