In this branch we will try to store the values into CSV file

CSV -> Comma Separated Values

Example:

inside CSV File: <br>
ISBN, Title, Author, Genre, Avaialble <br>
1234, Deep Work, Cal Newport, Computer Science, true <br>
1235, Atomic Habits, James Clear, Philosophy, true <br>

the plan is to load all of these books into memory <br>
upon executing the program <br>

and then during the execution the loaded data will be <br>
modified depending on the usage of the program<br>

Before the program is exited, we will unload the data  <br>
into the file so that we can access it again later
