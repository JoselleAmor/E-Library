In this branch we will try to store the values into CSV file

CSV -> Comma Separated Values

Example:

inside CSV File:
ISBN, Title, Author, Genre, Avaialble
1234, Deep Work, Cal Newport, Computer Science, true
1235, Atomic Habits, James Clear, Philosophy, true

the plan is to load all of these books into memory 
upon executing the program

and then during the execution the loaded data will be
modified depending on the usage of the program

Before the program is exited, we will unload the data 
into the file so that we can access it again later
